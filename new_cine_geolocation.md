#Geolocation Exercise

Geolocation is one of the coolest, easy to use APIs that you'll find. It is also one of the most common, being on a huge number of web pages. Before, we created our representation of a map on an image. This is great if we only want to map 1 static location on a map at all times, think of a local restaurant that has a map zoomed in on a location. Sometimes though we need a more detailed map. What if I have multiple locations for my restaurant? What if I need cool features like zooming, and dropping markers on different places.

This is where the google maps JavaScript API comes into play. The google maps JavaScript API is relatively easy to use, and has such a wide range of possibilities. We can do anything with our map, add markers, add info windows, create different styles of maps, and comes out of the box able to zoom in / out, and change where the map is centered.
